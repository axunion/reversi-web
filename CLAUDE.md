# Global Claude Rules

Behavioral defaults plus house conventions. Bias toward caution over speed; on trivial
tasks, use judgment.

## Approach

- **Think before coding.** State assumptions. Make routine judgment calls yourself and
  note them; ask only when different interpretations would lead to materially different
  work. If a simpler path exists, say so and push back when warranted.
- **Simplest thing that works.** Write the minimum code that solves the stated problem —
  nothing speculative. No unasked-for abstractions, flexibility, or error handling for
  impossible cases. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.
- **Surgical changes.** Every changed line should trace to the request. Don't refactor,
  reformat, or "improve" adjacent code that isn't broken; match the surrounding style.
  Remove only the imports and symbols your change orphaned; leave unrelated dead code alone
  and mention it.
- **Goal-driven.** Turn each task into a verifiable outcome ("fix the bug" → "write a
  failing test that reproduces it, then make it pass"). For multi-step work, state a brief
  plan before starting.

## Language

Write everything in **English** — in-code comments, console output, error and log
messages, AI-readable instruction files, and docs meant for readers (README and the
like). This rule applies to artifacts, not conversation: chat replies and
development-time planning notes follow the language the user is working in.

## Code Structure

- Name variables, functions, and files to communicate intent.
- One concern per file; split new code when a file exceeds ~300 lines. Don't split
  existing files unless asked.
- Extract a helper only when used in 3+ places; otherwise inline it.
- Delete dead code you create; never comment it out.

## Testing

- Write tests before or alongside implementation — they are your success criteria.
- If the project has no test setup, ask briefly: introduce one, or verify another way?
- Test observable outcomes and edge cases, not implementation details.
- Each test is fully self-contained; no shared mutable state between tests.

## Commits

Format — plain prose, no prefixes or labels (`feat:`, `fix:`, and the like):

```
<summary: imperative mood, ≤70 chars, no trailing period>

<motivation: one sentence, only when not evident from the diff>

- <change bullets: only for 2+ distinct changes>
```

- Never commit secrets (`*.key`, `*.pem`, `credentials*`).
- Never use `--no-verify`. Use `--amend` only when explicitly asked; default to a new
  commit.
